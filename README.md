# camera_ss

This is a libarary contains the primitives necessary to build an object space to clip-space transform.
It also includes a full implementation of an arc-ball like camera, with support of rotating and panning the view, as well
as animated 'snapping' to other views.

For now I can't recommend this library for general use.
However I have used it in both webgl and desktop opengl projects.
As I use it in more projects and hone the interface I will put effort into making it more widely adoptable.
